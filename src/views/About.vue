        Along with showing
        the "Bop Of The Day" and our Spotify playlist,
        we have the "100 Hottest Pop Artists In Nashville" chart
        with artists we have had the opportunity to feature on
        our Instagram. Each artist has a profile
        you can view to listen to their music and
        learn more about them.
