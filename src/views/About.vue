        <br>
        <b>Instagram:</b> Everyday we feature a “Bop Of The Day”
        by an up and coming Nashville pop artist.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Spotify:</b> Every month we update
        the Nashville Bops Next Up playlist with 15
        new songs by Nashville pop artists that
        we’ve recently featured on Instagram.

        <br>
        <b>Website:</b> Along with showing
        the Bop Of The Day and our Spotify playlist,
        we have a chart of the top 100 pop artists
        we’ve had the opportunity to feature on
        Instagram. Each artist has a profile
        you can view to listen to their music and
        learn more about them.
